## Ochothon flask sample

### Overview

This project is a simple [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) container definition that can be run on the
[**Ochothon**](https://github.com/autodesk-cloud/ochothon) PaaS. It of course requires a functional cluster running
the [**Marathon**](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) framework.

I just implemented a trivial REST endpoint using the fantabulous [**Flask**](http://flask.pocoo.org/). If you plan on
using a VPC make sure this container lands on a public facing instance.


### Deploy it !

Make sure you installed [**Ochothon**](https://github.com/autodesk-cloud/ochothon) first. Then simply use its CLI and
invoke the **deploy** tool, the image being already uploaded to the hub under _paugamo/marathon-ec2-flask-sample_. For
instance:

```
$ ./cli.py
welcome to the ocho CLI ! (CTRL-C to exit)
> deploy marathon-ec2-flask-sample/marathon.yml
100% success (spawned 1 pods)
```

Then look up what port 9000 is mapped to and use your browser ! For instance:

```
> port 9000 *sample
<*sample> -> 100% replies (1 pods total) ->

pod                       |  node IP         |  TCP
                          |                  |
marathon.flask-sample #0  |  54.144.138.148  |  9094
```

You should see a pretty picture with some text snippets. Enjoy !
